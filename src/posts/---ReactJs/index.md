## First Examples
The React homepage contains a few small React examples with a live editor. Even if you donâ€™t know anything about React yet, try changing their code and see how it affects the result.



```js
class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="shopping-list">
        <h1>Shopping List for {this.props.name}</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Instagram</li>
          <li>WhatsApp</li>
          <li>Oculus</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Example usage: <ShoppingList name="Mark" />

```
